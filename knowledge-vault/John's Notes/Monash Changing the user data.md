Monash have a requirement to obfusc the user data after we have copied it down from the production database to a sub database

the requested manner for rearrange of data Is to keep first name and surname as names but to jumble them up as the person cannot be recognised by the name. The payroll column should have a value in it that identifies an employee as being a valid employee. The names can be jumbled from the existing names in the database. The username should be replaced with the payroll number and then the domain example 12345 at monash dot EDU. 
.
Monash's tendency ID is one, Nimbus's tenancy ID is 2, No changes are to be made to the Nimbus tenancy IDS No changes are to be made to any user row or record that has a payroll ID.

we also need to add back some that require access to these databases, these can be import via a standard import process. There are two tables that need to updated the user Table and the user security role table.
