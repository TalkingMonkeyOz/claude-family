# Session Handoff: Area 2-5 Sweep (Areas 2 & 3 completed)
**Date:** 2026-02-24
**Status:** IN PROGRESS — Areas 2 and 3 done, Areas 4 and 5 remaining

## What Was Completed

### Area 2 — Integration Hub → FIRST PASS COMPLETE
- Reviewed existing README — already substantial from Doc 4
- John's key insight: Integration Hub is plumbing. The hard problem is what happens AFTER data arrives — storing it, cross-referencing it, making it actually useful. That's Knowledge Engine territory.
- No new vault file needed — README already covers connector pattern, list, bidirectional principle
- **Critical gap flagged in Knowledge Engine:** Explicit knowledge relationships / knowledge graph needed alongside semantic search. Vector similarity alone won't capture structural chains (API endpoint → config pattern → engagement → support ticket). Added to KE deep dive open questions.

### Area 3 — Delivery Accelerator → FIRST PASS COMPLETE
- New brainstorm file written: `ps-accelerator/brainstorm-delivery-accelerator.md`
- 5 decisions made:
  1. **Pipeline gate model:** Three tiers — mandatory (system-enforced), default-on (toggleable by customer admin), optional (addable). All BPMN-driven. Customer customisation Year 2+.
  2. **Living documentation model:** Three speeds — real-time DB writes, periodic RAG embedding (~4x daily), nightly batch regen with human review flags. "Never more than a day out of date," not real-time.
  3. **Lifecycle tier relationship:** DA runs Tier 2 and Tier 3 work. Tier 1 bypasses it.
  4. **Templates are KMS items:** Category C (Delivery Knowledge). No separate template system.
  5. **Generic framing:** nimbus/Monash are examples only, not design targets.
- Decisions tracker updated: 51 total, 44 resolved (86%)

## What's Next

### Area 4 — Quality & Compliance
- README exists with content from Doc 4
- Covers: Playwright testing, Award scenario generation, pay outcome validation, regression suites
- Needs: generic framing, tie to pipeline gates, relationship to Delivery Accelerator testing stage

### Area 5 — Support & Defect Intelligence
- README exists with content from Doc 1
- Covers: AI triage, duplicate detection, pattern recognition, defect lifecycle
- Needs: generic framing, tie to KMS, relationship to knowledge promotion

## Vault Files Updated This Session
- `knowledge-engine/brainstorm-knowledge-engine-deep-dive.md` — added CRITICAL open question on explicit knowledge relationships
- `ps-accelerator/brainstorm-delivery-accelerator.md` — NEW file
- `decisions/README.md` — 5 new DA decisions, scorecard updated to 51/44

## Process Notes
- Areas 2 and 3 moved faster than expected — much content already existed in READMEs
- John's approach: quick validation of what's there, focus on gaps, don't over-design the obvious
- Key recurring theme: cross-referencing and making knowledge useful is THE hard problem, not integration plumbing
