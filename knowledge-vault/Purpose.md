Claude Family is to look after all the other claudes and make sure that there set ups are consistent. 

This is don by giving context:

1 claud.md and the heirarchy of the layers of  [[claud.md structure]]
2 Postgres and sessions storage. 
3 memory graph
4 todo lists. 

The main challenge is to give claude as much structure to follow.
