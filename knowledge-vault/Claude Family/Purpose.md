Claude Family is to look after all the other claudes and make sure that there set ups are consistent. 

This is done by giving context and Structure:

1. Claud.md and the heirarchy of the layers of  [[claud.md structure]]
2. Postgres and sessions storage. [[Claude Family Postgres]]
3. Memory graph [[Claude Family Memory Graph]]
4. Todo lists. [[Claude Family todo Session Start]] and [[session End]]
5. [[MCP configuration]]
6. [[Plugins]]
7. [[Claude Hooks]]
8. [[Slash command's]]
9. [[Setting's File]]


The main challenge is to give claude as much structure to follow.
